          <p>
            Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
            moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
            restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and
            his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for
            the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic
            Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean
            region.
